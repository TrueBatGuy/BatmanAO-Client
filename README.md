# 🦇 BatmanAO-Client — Client for Community Multiplayer

This project helps with testing a **fan-made Batman: Arkham Origins multiplayer server**, developed to ensure the game’s online mode **does not disappear forever** and becomes stable and accessible again for everyone!

🎯 Goal — Restore & Improve BAO Multiplayer:
- ✅ Save level and loadout between sessions
- 🔄 Fix Rejoin (reconnect to match after disconnect)
- 💰 Bring back Arkham Credits
- 📦 Enable Penguin Crates (reverse engineering in progress)
- 🦇 Keep the community active and alive

## How to connect to the Batman Arkham Origins Online Server?

1) Download the latest release from this repository  
   *(or compile the tool yourself)*

2) Enter the my server address: http://arkhamorigins.ddns.net:8385/

3) The client will automatically modify: DefaultWBIDVars.ini

(path by default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Batman Arkham Origins\Online\BmGame\Config)

✨ It will also create a backup of the original file with a `.bak.<date>` extension in the same folder — so you can restore it anytime.

✅ If everything works correctly, you will see: "Connected to BatComputer!"

4) Launch the game and enjoy multiplayer!  
⚠️ Please note: The server is still **in active development**, so not all features listed above are fully functional yet.

## 🚧 Future plans for the client
In the future, the client may run continuously during gameplay.  
This would allow monitoring the player's state via Steam and enable additional functionality  
that is currently unavailable because the original game source code is not accessible.

## 🧪 Want to help testing?
Just join the multiplayer server, play a bit, and report anything unusual!  
Any feedback is extremely valuable ✅

Thanks for helping to keep Arkham Online alive! 💥🦇
